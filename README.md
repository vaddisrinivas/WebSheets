## How does this project work?
It takes a google-sheet that is shared publically and generates websites based on that.
However this excel sheet has to follow a very easy to create template that can be found here -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/17YiHNPSh8STfk1d6ZBjkvstJ_ZHLrrSd/view?usp=sharing

Jinja is used to render this data via the Lowdefy templates bundled here.
